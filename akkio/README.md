# Titanic Dataset Analysis with Akkio

This project demonstrates how to use Akkio for analyzing the Titanic dataset. 
By leveraging Akkio's no-code AutoML platform, we perform exploratory data analysis, model training, and predictions to understand survival patterns and improve predictive accuracy. 
This hands-on approach simplifies machine learning workflows and showcases Akkio's capabilities in handling real-world datasets.
