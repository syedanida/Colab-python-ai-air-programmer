# Using Copilot in Visual Studio Code to Create a Streamlit Application Frontend

This project leverages GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to build a simple yet interactive Streamlit application. 
The app features a user-friendly frontend with a text box for inputting prompts, a "Generate Response" button to capture and process user inputs, and a subheader that dynamically displays the response. This exercise demonstrates how to use Copilot to streamline coding, enhance productivity, and create engaging web applications using Streamlit.
