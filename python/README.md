# Using Python Code to Familiarize with Google Colab

This project explores the use of Python code in Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. 
It is designed to help users familiarize themselves with key features such as code execution, data analysis, and visualization using popular libraries like NumPy and Pandas. 
The notebook demonstrates how to leverage Colab's collaborative tools, GPU acceleration, and integration with Google Drive for seamless project management and development.
